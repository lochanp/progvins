        Progvins expertise in Electroless Nickel Plating, is rich and diverse. Progvins has mastered high, 
        medium and low phosphorus electroless nickel plating system for components of various sizes and shapes
         including substrates like stainless steel and aluminum alloys . The electroless nickel coatings of 
         Progvins have well-known properties such as corrosion resistance, lubricity, solderability, diamagnetic 
         properties and hardness with defined ranges. Stringent inline control over various process parameters 
         and unit operations ensures the consistent and high quality of our electroless nickel plating.

    <h1 class="inner-heading">What is Electroless Nickel Plating ?
    </h1>
    <p class="content">Electroless nickel plating is an immersion-based autocatalytic plating method that, unlike many similar techniques, does not require an electrical current. We utilise a chemical reducing agent
        to reduce the nickel ions in a metal deposit. With different solutions and multiple applications, it is easy enough to vary the thickness of the metal plating in this way.
        Electroless nickel plating services offer solutions to your production processes while 
        conserving operational costs. If youâ€™re looking for a cost-efficient means of coating 
        large component batches, Progvins has an electroless nickel plating service for you.

            Progvins offers a variety of electroless nickel plating services. They are :<br><br>
            <small><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i></small> High phosphorus Method : For ,better protection against corrosion we recommend a nickel-phosphorus alloy, which provides treatments depending on the nature of your components and their intended purpose.<br>

            <small><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i></small> Medium Phosphorus Method : If your primary concern is wear and tear, consider a sturdy nickel-boron alloy. For high-end components subjected to extreme conditions, composite nickel coatings are preferred, which may include carbides, polymers or diamonds to reduce wear resistance.<br>
            
            <small><i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i></small> Low Phosphorus Method : In this method ENP produces a uniform finish across the components, and greater corrosion resistance in alkaline environments.<br>
            Our electroless nickel plating facilities allow the infusion of ceramics into the nickel coating for increased durability. The use of low friction fluorinated carbon composites creates a dry and self-lubricating component coating.
            Whatever specific qualities you need for your plated components, we will be able to adjust the phosphorous levels to meet them.

        <h1 class="inner-heading">Advantages/Benefits of Electroless Nickel Plating</h1>
        <p class="content">
             Electroless nickel plating services provide durable nickel coating 
             which can be deposited with accuracy and at carefully controlled thicknesses. Finishes are even, and 
             the process can be adjusted to create matte, semi-bright or bright finishes.
             Electroless nickel plating brings its own range of benefits to the table. It is a very energy efficient process, 
             as it does not require an electrical current to create a deposit of nickel on the surface metal. 
             Thanks to the immersion technique used to complete the process, complicated shapes can receive a thorough coating, 
             something which cannot always be guaranteed with other methods. Inexpensive, hardy and corrosion resistant, electroless nickel plating is 
             an alternative to more expensive plating solutions.
