    <h1 class="inner-heading">What is Palladium Plating ?
    </h1>
    <p class="content">
        Palladium is easy to recognize due to its somewhat bright, silver-blue appearance, its low density and its low melting point.
        Progvins has designed the palladium electroplating process to meet the increasing demand for extreme thickness required in 
        the modern manufacturing environment. Palladium is a natural element with the chemical symbol Pd and the 
        atomic number 46. It is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the six platinum metals. Palladium is a precious metal with numerous properties that make it an excellent choice of plating material, especially in the automotive and electronics industries.

        Progvins has designed the palladium electroplating process to meet the increasing demand for extreme thickness required in the modern manufacturing environment. 
        We adhere to best practices throughout the palladium electroplating process to ensure the highest possible quality.During the palladium electroplating preparation process, we begin by carefully examining the basis material
        and thoroughly cleaning it via processes such as preheating, polishing and ultrasonic cleaning. As the 
        plating cycles occur, maintaining the proper strikes of palladium and nickel ensures maximum adhesion.
        After the palladium plating process, a heat treatment removes any excess trapped hydrogen from the final 
        product. Additional processes, such as applying a secondary gold plating coating on top of the palladium 
        plating, can also enhance protection.
