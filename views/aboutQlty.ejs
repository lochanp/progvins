        Progvins has its own laboratory with dedicated and full time chemists, who carry out all the tests on raw materials,
         formulations, compounds, additives, chemicals and most importantly plated components with an array of sophisticated, regularly calibrated instruments. 
        This help us generate accurate certification of quality and tolerance adherence.

            <p class="card-text">At Progvins we are aware that establishing process sequences and parameters isn’t enough. Equally important is the stringent implementation of these process sequences and parameters, in order to avoid compounding losses in quality and cost efficiency of the process. Hence the focus while carrying out plating jobs is not just on the process chemicals, but also on the adherence to the process parameters and the continuous education of the operators.</p>

            <p class="card-text">“Prevention is better than cure”, it’s evident in the plating industry. Accurate pre treatment of the substrate, gives the desired finish quality and functional features. In addition,an appropriate post-treatment helps the object to retain its finish quality and functional properties. Progvins uses its years of research and vast know-how to choose the most appropriate pre and post-treatments, for its job work. This helps us achieve an uniform finish quality and increase the plating’s functional properties.</p>
