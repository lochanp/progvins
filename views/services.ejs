            <p class="card-text">Gold is prized for its high resistance to oxidation and electrical conductivity. Gold plating, which differs from gilding in that the gold is not a foil, is one of the simplest ways to impart these characteristics on metals such as copper and silver. 
                Gold electroplating, relies on a chemical process to combine various layers of metal into a solid piece with a layer of gold resting on the surface.
                Gold plating can be added to almost any metal, including brass, copper or nickel. Silver items can also be gold-plated.

            <p class="card-text">Copper is another popular plating metal for applications that require high conductivity and cost-efficiency. 
                Copper plating often serves as a strike coating pretreatment for subsequent metal platings, as discussed above.
                It is also a popular plating metal for electronics components such as printed circuit boards. High-plating efficiency and low material cost make copper one of the less expensive metals to plate with.
                There are three types of copper plating processesâ€”alkaline, mildly alkaline, and acid. </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Nickel Plating</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Nickel is a popular plating metal, especially because it is useful in electroless plating. Nickel plating often coats household products such as doorknobs, cutlery, and shower fixtures for enhanced decoration and wear resistance.
                 Nickel plates commonly bond with copper and aluminum, but also work on a wide variety of metals and serve as underlying platings for chromium.
                 In electroless plating, a nickel phosphorous alloy is used.

            <h5 class="card-title">Silver Plating</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Rhodium is a type of platinum that provides tarnish resistance, scratch-resistance, and a shiny,
                white lustrous appearance. Rhodium plating is also common in jewelry production, especially in situations where white gold requires plating. 
                Silver, platinum, and copper are also popular base metals for rhodium plating.
                One downside of rhodium plating is that the protective barrier of rhodium will eventually wear away in applications that are subjected to high levels of wear
