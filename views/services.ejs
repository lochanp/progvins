         Electroless nickel plating (or ENP) is a method of metal finishing that does not require the use 
        of an electrical current. Chemical reducing agents such as sodium hydrosphite are used to produce
        a deposit of metallic nickel through the reduction of nickel ions. This uniform coating process means 
        that even complex shapes can receive a complete nickel plating, leaving them highly resistant to corrosion.

         Hugely popular in the electronics industry, thanks to its conductive qualities and resistance to both 
         corrosion and heat, gold plating remains one of our most sought-after processes.Gold is one of the
         easiest metals to electroplate, mainly due to the fact that it is almost inert. For this reason it forms an excellent undercoat for plating 
         onto passive metals, for example high chromium-nickel containing alloys such as stainless steel.

                Gold electroplating, relies on a chemical process to combine various layers of metal into a solid piece with a layer of gold resting on the surface.
                Gold plating can be added to almost any metal, including brass, copper or nickel. Silver items can also be gold-plated.
