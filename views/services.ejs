        <div class="inner-content para">
         Electroless nickel plating (or ENP) is a method of metal finishing that does not require the use 
        of an electrical current. Chemical reducing agents such as sodium hydrosphite are used to produce
        a deposit of metallic nickel through the reduction of nickel ions. This uniform coating process means 
        that even complex shapes can receive a complete nickel plating, leaving them highly resistant to corrosion.

        We have a number of different techniques for plating with gold, all of which produce impeccable results.
         Hugely popular in the electronics industry, thanks to its conductive qualities and resistance to both 
         corrosion and heat, gold plating remains one of our most sought-after processes.Gold is one of the
         easiest metals to electroplate, mainly due to the fact that it is almost inert. For this reason it forms an excellent undercoat for plating 
         onto passive metals, for example high chromium-nickel containing alloys such as stainless steel.

        As one of the most electrically conductive metals on the market, silver is a natural 
        choice for the electronics and connector market. Our silver plating process can produce
         a vast range of thickness from a flash upto 8mm thick.At Progvins, we have a long history of 
         intensive research in the field of Silver Plating. More than two decades ago we carried out the silver plating on aluminum for the electrical and electronic industry.

        Like other precious metals, platinum (Pt) offers durability, longevity and value to products 
        that use it for plating. With a finish of platinum on the exterior of a part, it gains the benefits
         of the metal without the cost of creating a solid part using this material. In platinum plating thicknesses of coating ranges
          from 0.125 to 25 microns.

        Rhodium is one of the rarest metals on earth, which also makes it one of the most expensive.
         It is an extremely durable element that has a gorgeous pure silver-white color that is highly reflective.
         Rhodium plating, also known as rhodium dip or rhodium flashing, is used to increase the durability, luster
          and light reflection , because it is a hard metal, a rhodium plated piece of metal will be more scratch resistant.
