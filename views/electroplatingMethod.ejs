            Electroplating is a general name for processes that create a metal coating on a solid substrate 
            through the reduction of cations of that metal by means of a direct electric current. 
            The part to be coated acts as the cathode of an electrolytic cell; the electrolyte is a solution of a salt of the metal to be coated; and the anode is usually either a block of that metal, or of some inert conductive material.
            Electroplating is widely used in industry and decorative arts to improve the surface qualities of objectsâ€”such as resistance to abrasion and corrosion, lubricity, reflectivity, electrical conductivity, or appearance.
            The term "electroplating" may also be used occasionally for processes that use an electric current to achieve oxidation of anions on to a solid substrate

            In this process the electrolyte should contain positive ions of the metal to be deposited. These cations are reduced at the cathode to the metal in the zero valence state.
            When the anode is made of the coating metal, the opposite reaction may occur there, turning it into dissolved cations.
            The anode may instead be made of a material that resists electrochemical oxidation, such as lead or carbon. Oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or some other byproducts are then produced at the anode instead. 
            The plating is most commonly a single metallic element, not an alloy. However, some alloys can be electrodeposited, notably brass and solder. <br><br>
