        At Progvins, We offer many plating capabilities with this Platinum, including means of customizing your order based on Thickness of the coating.
        Like other precious metals, platinum (Pt) offers durability, longevity and value to products that use it for plating.
        With a finish of platinum on the exterior of a part, it gains the benefits of the metal without the cost of creating a solid part using this material.

    <h1 class="inner-heading">What is Platinum Plating ?
    </h1>
    <p class="content">Platinum plating occurs through electroplating, which uses electricity and an electrolyte
        solution to deposit the ions of this metal onto the surface of the targeted base. The thickness of the 
        deposit depends on the solution used and its processing time. The electrical and electronics industries use
         platinum plating for low voltage and low energy contacts. In electroplating, platinum is often used to coat
          titanium, niobium, or stainless steel anodes. It is also used in the jewelry industry.

        <p class="content">
            Rhodium is plated using an electroplating process. For a piece of jewelry to be plated, it must first be thoroughly cleaned to remove all contaminants. If there is any dirt on the piece, the plating will not hold.
Distilled water, steam cleaning and electro cleaning are some ways that the item is cleaned before it is dipped into the rhodium solution. A positive electrical charge is then used to fuse the rhodium onto the base metal.
Care must be taken, because if the electric current is too high, the rhodium plating will turn black. The process takes roughly around an hour and a half to be completed.
